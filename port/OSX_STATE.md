# OSX PORT STATE — durable snapshot

Updated whenever status materially changes. Newest section top.
(Companion to `OSX_PORT.md` (branch model), `OSX_ROADMAP.md` (per-module
status) and `OSX_STRATEGY.md` (phased plan-of-record, PR #130).)

## 2026-09-09 — strategy locked: native port, phased, PR-per-layer

- `port/OSX_STRATEGY.md` merged via PR #130: port-don't-emulate decision,
  measured surface (238 raw syscalls; C layer POSIX-clean except 2 prctl
  uses; no futex/epoll/eventfd), 5 phases (p0 build bridge → p1 pure-compute
  → p2 syscall I/O → p3 daemon → p4 parity), PR branches `osx/pN-*` merged
  --no-ff into bmc_osx with green gates.
- First working PR target: p0 sha256 proof module (Mach-O build + native
  harness + differential fuzz vs hashlib/Python).

## 2026-09-09 — round 0: fresh start on `bmc_osx`

- Branch `bmc_osx` forked from `main` @1dac38ae (upstream through PR #127,
  addnode dials), pushed to origin, local clone at `~/bmc_osx/bitcoinmachinecode`.
- `main` is declared the x86-64 development tree; `bmc_osx` merges from it,
  never develops into it.
- Toolchain verified: Apple clang 21.0.0, macOS 26.6.2, M1 Max (arm64).
- Reuse strategy: arm-port branch (origin) is the algorithm reference — all
  63 modules were ported and differential-verified there — but its syscall
  layer is Linux-only (`svc #0`, nr in x8). Darwin needs `svc #0x80`,
  nr in x16, Mach-O sections/symbols (`_` prefix), no x28 use, PIC via
  adrp/add. Rough rework weight per module (svc counts from arm-port .S):
  utxo_lsm 66, store 42, utxo_store 30, idxscan 19, undo 18, store_fast 17.
- Docs created: `port/OSX_PORT.md`, `port/OSX_ROADMAP.md`, this file.
- Next: pick the first module (pure-compute, no syscalls — e.g. sha256 or
  bitcoin_hash) to prove the Mach-O build+verify loop end to end.
